- Your repo containing everyting required to modify and test the code as if you were working on it from your original project directory.

## Get Involved

Join our discord server and let's start learning Japanese. With the help of the [30 Day Japanese](https://learnjapanese.moe/routine/) you'll learn Japanese from scratch with the immersion method. 

What you'll expect to know at the end of the 30 days:

- An understanding of the most common Japanese grammar patterns
- A vocabulary of at least 500 words.
- An understanding of basic sentences in slice of life anime.
- The ability to read hiragana, katakana and some common kanji.
- A good foundation to continue learning Japanese on your own.
